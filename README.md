# SUTDMonopoly

> CDT 1D Project <br/>
> Cohort 11 Group 7

Description:
This is a text-based game based on the board game "monopoly". As with Monopoly, players are eliminated when they run out of the currency, "Sanity". 
Players will move their pieces around the board from the Start, or "Home" tile. Upon landing on an unclaimed property tile, they can choose to purchase the property
for a predetermined amount of "Sanity". Any subsequent players landing on this tile will have to transfer a predetermined amount of "Sanity" to the owner of the tile.

Special thanks to Tim for not sleeping and CS for raging during debugging.
